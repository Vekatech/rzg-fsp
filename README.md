## Overview

Flexible Software Package (FSP) for Renesas RZ/G MPU Series

FSP is the next generation Arm® MPU software package from Renesas, that enables HMI devices and IoT connectivity through production ready peripheral drivers, FreeRTOS, and portable middleware stacks.
FSP includes best-in-class HAL drivers with high performance and low memory footprint. Middleware stacks with FreeRTOS integration are included to ease implementation of complex modules like communication.
The e² studio IDE provides support with intuitive configurators and intelligent code generation to make programming and debugging easier and faster.

FSP uses an open software ecosystem and provides flexibility in using your preferred RTOS, legacy code, and third-party ecosystem solutions.
